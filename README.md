Project Scope:
	Utilizing Spotipy and Spotify API to extract song data and analyze its attributes. Spotipy is a Python library that grants full access to the Spotify API. The data that will be analyzed are song attributes such as valence, energy, and tempo. The goal for this project is to use the different attributes of the songs of different artists to determine what makes them popular using regression analysis. Afterwards, the data will then be added to Hadoop for future use.
